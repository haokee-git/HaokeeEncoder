# HaokeeEncoder

This a WinUI 3 application. It's made by haokee. It can help you encode and decode text by Base64 and other encoding rules.

I want to make it a useful tool. So I didn't pay any attention to the UI design. WinUI 3 is a good choice and I used it. But executable file and Dynamic libraries will be large.

Considering the friends of China, please use 123 Pan [link](https://www.123684.com/s/OkLLVv-0fsBH) instead of downloading from Github.
